# 11 Plots of Data Science

This repository showcases 11 essential plots used in data science. These plots are crucial for understanding various aspects of data and model performance.

## Table of Plots

| Plot                            | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| KS Plot                         | Kolmogorov-Smirnov plot used for evaluating the goodness of fit of a model.  |
| SHAP Value                      | SHapley Additive exPlanations value plot for interpreting model predictions.|
| ROC-AUC                         | Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve for evaluating binary classifiers. |
| QQ Plot                         | Quantile-Quantile plot for comparing two probability distributions.         |
| Cumulative Explained Variance   | Plot showing the cumulative variance explained by each principal component.  |
| Elbow Plot                      | Used in cluster analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.       |
| Silhouette Curve                | Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. |
| Gini Impurity vs Entropy        | Comparison of Gini impurity and entropy in decision trees.                  |
| Bias Variance Tradeoff          | Illustrates the tradeoff between bias and variance in model performance.    |
| Dependency Plot                 | Shows the relationship between the target and a feature in the dataset.     |

Each plot has its unique importance and application within data science, helping to diagnose, evaluate, and interpret models and data distributions.
