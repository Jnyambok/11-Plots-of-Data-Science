# 11 Plots of Data Science

This repository showcases 11 essential plots used in data science. These plots are crucial for understanding various aspects of data and model performance.

## Table of Plots

| Plot                            | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| KS Plot                         | The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Plot is a nonparametric (not of normal distribution) test used extensively in statistical analysis to compare two distributions. It serves as a visual and analytical tool to determine if two samples come from the same distribution.   |
| SHAP Value                      |SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) plots are a powerful visualization tool used to understand the impact of individual features on a machine learning model's predictions. SHAP values are model-agnostic, meaning they can be used to interpret any machine learning model|
| ROC-AUC                         | The receiver operating characteristics curve is visual representation of model performance across all thresholds. Binary classifiers output the probability of a data point belonging to the positive class.. |
| QQ Plot                         | The quantile-quantile( QQ plot) plot is a graphical method for determining if a dataset follows a certain probability distribution or whether two samples of data came from the same population or not.         |
| Cumulative Explained Variance   | The Cumulative Explained Variance plot is a graphical representation that shows the proportion of the datasetâ€™s variance that is cumulatively explained by each component.  |
| Elbow Plot                      | The elbow method is a heuristic used in determining the number of clusters in a data set. The method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use     |
| Silhouette Curve                | Just like elbow plot but indepth |
| Gini Impurity vs Entropy        | Measuring Impurity in Decision Trees                  |
| Bias Variance Tradeoff          | Illustrates the tradeoff between bias and variance in model performance.    |
| Partial Dependency Plot                 | Shows the relationship between the target and a feature in the dataset.     |

Each plot has its unique importance and application within data science, helping to diagnose, evaluate, and interpret models and data distributions.
